# CLANK FROM DOCS

welcome to the example js/ts code! 

the first step here is you'll want to make a .env out of the example.env and run `pnpm install` (or `npm install`)

after that, add your token deployment info into `deploy-cli.ts` to configure interface and creator information

before running, check out the `DeployToken.ts` and files to get a gist of what's going on to build a clanker

when you're ready, run this like this: `npm run deploy-token`
