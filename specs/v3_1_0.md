# Clanker v3.1.0

Clanker is a token launchpad enabling creators to deploy tokens and earn a portion of the trading fees generated from those tokens. v3.1.0 enables token vaulting, inital buys, permissionless token deployements, and super-chain compatibility.

## Deployment Flows

Most tokens are not deployed directly by creators, but rather by the Clanker team or external interface partners. The main token deployment flows are:

1. Our team on behalf of a creator through our Farcaster bot [@clanker](https://cast.clanker.world/) or our website [clanker.world](https://www.clanker.world/)
2. External interface partners (e.g., [@bankrbot](https://x.com/bankrbot) on Twitter) via our web2 API
3. Other entities (self-sufficient external interface partners or anyone else who wants to deploy a token) via the `deployToken()` function. This is a new user flow introduced in v3.1. Previously, only the team could deploy tokens on behalf of others.

## Key Entities

In the code, there are four main entities:

- **Owner** of the contracts, which will be the Clanker team's multisig
- **Admins** on the Clanker contract, which will be EOAs controlled by the Clanker team
- **Interfaces**, which are external partners that deploy tokens on behalf of creators
- **Creators**, which are the entities creating the tokens

Rewards generated from the deployed tokens are split between the Clanker team, the creator, and optionally, an interface.

## Core Contracts

Clanker consists of five main contracts:

1. **ClankerToken**: A super-chain compatible ERC20 contract.
2. **Clanker**: The primary contract responsible for token deployment, Uniswap V3 Pool creation, and single-sided liquidity position placement. Users can optionally perform an initial swap and deposit a portion of the token supply into a time-locked vault.
3. **ClankerDeployer**: A helper library which exists to reduce the code size of the Clanker contract.
4. **ClankerVault**: A contract for creators to manage and collect their locked tokens.
5. **LpLockerv2**: A contract for creators to manage and collect their portion of the trading fees generated from their token's pool. This contract is also used by the Clanker team to collect their portion of the trading fees.

## Deploying a Token

Tokens are deployed through the Clanker contract using the `deployToken` and `deployTokenWithCustomTeamRewardRecipient` functions:

```solidity
/**
 * Configuration settings for token creation
 */

struct RewardsConfig {
    uint256 creatorReward;
    address creatorAdmin;
    address creatorRewardRecipient;
    address interfaceAdmin;
    address interfaceRewardRecipient;
}

struct TokenConfig {
    string name;
    string symbol;
    bytes32 salt;
    string image;
    string metadata;
    string context;
    uint256 originatingChainId;
}

struct VaultConfig {
    uint8 vaultPercentage;
    uint256 vaultDuration;
}

struct PoolConfig {
    address pairedToken;
    int24 tickIfToken0IsNewToken;
}

struct InitialBuyConfig {
    uint24 pairedTokenPoolFee;
    uint256 pairedTokenSwapAmountOutMinimum;
}

struct DeploymentConfig {
    TokenConfig tokenConfig;
    VaultConfig vaultConfig;
    PoolConfig poolConfig;
    InitialBuyConfig initialBuyConfig;
    RewardsConfig rewardsConfig;
}

function deployToken(DeploymentConfig tokenConfig) external payable {...}
function deployTokenWithCustomTeamRewardRecipient(DeploymentConfig tokenConfig, address teamRewardRecipient) external payable {...}
```

### RewardsConfig

Rewards deployed through the launchpad are split as follows:

- 20% to the Clanker Team
- Up to 80% to the Creator (set with the `creatorReward` parameter)
- Remaining to the Interface (can be 0%)

Four addresses must be specified for token deployment:

- `creatorAdmin`: The address that will manage the creator's locked token supply, creator's portion of the trading fee rewards, the token's metadata, and the receiver of the initial supply purchase
- `creatorRewardRecipient`: The address that will initially receive the creator's portion of the trading fee rewards
- `interfaceAdmin`: The address that will manage the interface's trading fee rewards
- `interfaceRewardRecipient`: The address that will initially receive the interface's portion of the trading fee rewards

If using the `deployTokenWithCustomTeamRewardRecipient` function, the team reward recipient must be specified:

- `teamRewardRecipient`: The address that will initially receive the team's portion of the trading fee rewards (instead of the default address set on the LpLockerv2 contract)

### Token Configuration

The following parameters are required for token creation:

- `name`: Token name
- `symbol`: Token symbol
- `image`: Token image
- `metadata`: Token metadata (Creator's admin key can update this)
- `context`: Additional token context containing information about who deployed the token (immutable)
- `salt`: Address salt value to allow for token address customization
- `originatingChainId`: Chain ID where the token's supply is deployed

Supply is set to 100 billion tokens with 18 decimals.

### Vault Configuration (Optional)

Users can lock a portion of the token supply in a vault with these parameters:

- `vaultDuration`: Lock duration (minimum 30 days)
- `vaultPercentage`: Percentage of supply to lock (maximum 30%)

The `creatorAdmin` address will have administrative control over the locked tokens in the ClankerVault contract.

### Pool Configuration

After token creation, a 1% fee tiered Uniswap V3 Pool is deployed. The remaining non-vaulted token supply is then added as a single-sided liquidity position. Required parameters:

- `tickIfToken0IsNewToken`: Initial token price in the pool
- `pairedToken`: Token to pair with the new token

The liquidity position's NFT is transferred to the LpLockerv2 contract, where each fee-receiving entity has control over who receives their portion of the trading fees.

### Initial Swap Configuration (Optional)

Users can perform an initial swap using ETH (sent via `msg.value`). For non-WETH paired tokens, the contract first internally swaps ETH to the paired token (ETH -> pairedToken -> new token). Required parameters:

- `msg.value`: ETH amount for the swap
- `pairedTokenSwapAmountOutMinimum`: Minimum amount of paired tokens to receive if ETH is not the paired token
- `pairedTokenPoolFee`: Pool fee for the ETH -> pairedToken swap

The `creatorAdmin` address receives the new tokens purchased with the ETH sent.

## ClankerVault Contract

The ClankerVault contract manages locked tokens from the Clanker contract. Only the Clanker contract can deposit tokens into the vault, and tokens can only be vaulted once. Each token has the `creatorAdmin` as the initial admin for the token. The token's address (emitted and returned from `deployToken()`) is used as the token parameter for all ClankerVault functions.

### User Functions

`withdraw()`: Allows users to withdraw tokens that have reached their unlock time

```solidity
// note: will revert if not called by the token's admin
function withdraw(
    address token,    // Token to withdraw
    uint256 amount,   // Withdrawal amount
    address to        // Recipient address
) external {...}
```

`editAllocationAdmin()`: Allows changing the token's admin

```solidity
// note: will revert if not called by the token's admin
function editAllocationAdmin(
    address token,    // Token to modify
    address newAdmin  // New administrator address
) external {...}
```

## LpLockerv2 Contract

The LpLockerv2 contract manages trading fees from the Clanker contract, with a 20/80 split between the Clanker Team and token's interface/creator. Only the Clanker contract can deposit new liquidity position NFTs. The `tokenId` parameter is the token's associated liquidity position NFT ID (emitted and returned from `deployToken()`).

### User Functions

`updateCreatorRewardAdmin()`: Allows creator NFT admin to change the admin for their token

```solidity
// note: will revert if not called by the token's admin
function updateCreatorRewardAdmin(
    uint256 tokenId,  // Token ID to update
    address newAdmin  // New administrator address
) public {...}
```

A similar function exists for the interface's reward recipient, `updateInterfaceRewardAdmin()`.

`updateCreatorRewardRecipient()`: Allows creator NFT admin to update the reward recipient for their token

```solidity
// note: will revert if not called by the token's admin
function updateCreatorRewardRecipient(
    uint256 tokenId,      // Token ID to update
    address newRecipient  // New reward recipient
) public {...}
```

A similar function exists for the interface's reward recipient, `updateInterfaceRewardRecipient()`.

`claimRewards()`: Allows any address to claim accumulated trading fees

```solidity
// note: callable by anyone
function claimRewards(
    uint256 tokenId  // Token ID for claiming rewards
) public {...}
```

Claimed rewards are distributed with 20% going to the Clanker Team and 80% split between the creator and the interface. If the reward recipient is set to the zero address for non-team rewards, the Clanker Team receives all fees.

## Administrative Permissions

### Clanker Contract Owner

- Can update associated addresses (`IUniswapV3Factory`, `INonfungiblePositionManager`, `ISwapRouter`, `address weth`, `address liquidityLocker`, `address vault`) via the `initialize()` function
- Can update ClankerVault contract address via `updateVault()`
- Can update LpLockerv2 contract address via `updateLiquidityLocker()`
- Can set the deprecated flag via `setDeprecated()`. Note: contracts start out as deprecated and are undeprecated during the `initialize()` function
- Can add admins via `setAdmin()` (admins are able to call the `deployTokenWithCustomTeamRewardRecipient()` function)

### ClankerVault Contract Owner

- Can modify minimum vault time via `editMinimumVaultTime()`

### LpLockerv2 Contract Owner

- Can override team reward address for specific NFTs via `setOverrideTeamRewardRecipientForToken()`
- Can update team reward recipient via `updateClankerTeamRecipient()`
- Can withdraw ETH via `withdrawETH()`
- Can withdraw ERC20 tokens via `withdrawERC20()`

## SuperChain Compatibility

Clanker is `SuperChainerc20` compatible such that if a token is deployed on one chain, it can be re-deployed on other compatible super-chains with the same token address. The `originatingChainId` parameter is used to determine if the initial supply should be minted. If the `originatingChainId` is not the current chain, zero supply will be minted and users are expected to utilize the super-chain's brige to migrate their tokens. Tokens can only be minted with supply on the originating chain, and cannot be minted with zero supply on the originating chain.

We use Foundry's `CREATE2` deployment support to ensure that our factory contract (Clanker) can have the same address on different chains. This is needed to have the same resulting token addresses on the different chains.

Super-chain documentation can be found [here](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/interop/superchain-erc20).

Note: for a token to be able to be bridged between super-chains, the superchains must be in the same superchain cluster. This is subject to user error if the Clanker contract is not properly initialized on the target chain, and if the target chain is not part of the same superchain cluster.

The function `deployTokenZeroSupply()` can be used to deploy a token with zero supply. This is useful for tokens that are bridged to a super-chain:

```solidity
// Use the same tokenConfig as that was used to deploy the token on the
// originating chain with the `creatorAdmin as the `tokenAdmin`
function deployTokenZeroSupply(TokenConfig memory tokenConfig, address tokenAdmin) external returns (address tokenAddress) {...}
```
